                  <p class="font-size">My name is Fredrik Fordelsen and I'm currently studying my first year of Front-End Development at Noroff in Bergen. During the school year I've learned about web design, and programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are things that I've used in some of the previous assignments that I've showcased here, as well as on this page.</p>
                  <p class="font-size">If you scroll down on this page you'll see that I've showcased some of the larger assignments that I've completed during my first year at school. I have also included a short description under each of the assignments.</p>

                <p class="text-variation">This was a website I made for one of the first assignments I recieved with HTML and CSS. The assignment was to make a website for a fictive company that was looking to open more stores in Norway. Since I hadn't learned any other coding languages than HTML and CSS, I had to make the most of what I knew so far. This meant making the website as responsive as possible by using CSS classes.</p>
                <p class="text-variation">Another part of the assignment was also to design the website, so everything you see on the page has been taken into consideration under the creation process.</p>

                <p class="text-variation">This was my previous semester project. The assignment I got was to design and make a website for a company that makes a math game for children that are in elementary school. I made the website by using what I had learned so far within HTML and CSS, so in hindsight I wasn't able to make the website like I would want to.</p>
                <p class="text-variation">If I could have made the website now, I would have used JavaScript to simplify the code and add certain elements to make the site more responsive.</p>

                <p class="text-variation">This was one of the more recent assignment I got. The goal of the task was to make a website using WordPress through a local host. Upon starting the assignment, I got a document containing the site's assets, which I filled in to design the website. I also added elements to website's shop page, as well as adding a new element.</p>
                <p class="text-variation">I completed the assignment by migrating the local website to my live host by using a WordPress plugin and opening a SQL host on my CPanel page.</p>
